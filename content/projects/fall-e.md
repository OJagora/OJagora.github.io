# FALL-E: Fall Detection System

I constructed a first prototype of a fall detection system based on a inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an analysis of the signal with metrics such as the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) and the Fall Index (FI).

The system was able to correctly detect falls from a circuit motorbike online dataset and a home made cyclist databse.

**This system could be miniaturized and integrated into a helmet to detect falls in real time and alert the emergency services in case of an accident.** 

The algorithm used enables to tailor the detection based on the mean of transportation : bike, scooter, ski etc.
