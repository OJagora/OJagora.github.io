## Overview

This project provides tools to simulate and visualize diffraction patterns under different scenarios:

1. **White Light Diffraction**: Generate and visualize diffraction patterns for custom objects under polychromatic (white light) illumination.

2. **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Diffraction**: Simulate and study the diffraction pattern produced by the hexagonal mirror configuration of the JWST.

These simulations leverage **Fourier Transforms** and **polychromatic light** calculations, providing customizable and high-resolution outputs.

## Features

### White Light Diffraction
- Simulate diffraction patterns of arbitrary objects in the visible spectrum (380–780 nm).
- Combine patterns for multiple wavelengths into realistic RGB images.
- Customizable object shapes, dimensions, and sampling resolutions.

### James Webb Space Telescope Diffraction
- Model the JWST's hexagonal mirror array and its optical diffraction properties.
- Use accurate mirror configurations to visualize the telescope's characteristic diffraction pattern.
- Custom Sampling Technique
