As an intern at the CNRS [BioCIS](https://www.pamir.fr/reseau/biocis/) lab (2023) I worked with a team of two professors and a PhD student on a project to develop a new method to quantify the novelty of a compound.

I mainly worked on :
- Analysis of indices (Tanimoto and Modified Cosine) definition and implementation by different tools
- Analysis of fingerprints generation methods (such as Morgan Fingerprints)
- Sensibility analysis of a confidence function
- Proposal of a function to quantify novelty of a compound

Currently, the project is still ongoing and the team is working on the publication of the results that will be presented at the end of the year (2024).
