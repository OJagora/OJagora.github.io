In this project with a team of 2 students, we aimed to predict the success of a crowdfunding campaign based on several features such as the category of the project, the goal, the duration etc.

We used different models such as:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Bayesian Regression**

We anylized more deeply the context of crowdfunding campaigns and the impact of the features on the success of the campaign.

> For example, this graph illustrate the importance of raising money during the first quarter of the campaign. We can see that the probability of success is almost two to three times higher per percentage of the goal raised during the first quarter. **When a project raises 20% of its goal during the first quarter, the probability of success in the end is of 50%.**
