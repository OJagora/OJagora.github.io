> This is a graph of molecular similarity between different compounds using fingerprints and tanimoto similarity.

MRB is a work in progress personal research project that aims to benchmark the different representations of molecules in the context of a **similarity search**.

The project is based on different techniques such as:
- Graph Theory (Louvain Clustering)
- Molecular fingerprints (Morgan)
- Graph Kernel (Weisfeiler-Lehman)
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

The goal is to understand the impact of the representation of a molecule on the prediction of activity of a compound.
