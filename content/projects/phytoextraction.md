# Phytoextraction: Using Plants to Clean Radioactive Soil

**Period:** 2018  
**Category:** Academic (High School Project)

---

As a High School student, I worked with 14 other students and three teachers on a project to clean radioactive soil with plants, after having met with Fukushima students.

We worked with the [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) and the [IRSN](https://www.irsn.fr/) to grow cesium-133 contaminated plants and measure the amount of cesium absorbed by the plants using mass spectrometry.

> This is a Table of the concentration of cesium in the plants after 3 weeks of growth. We calculated the *Transfer Factor* of cesium in the plants to measure the capcity of plants to absorb the radioactive element present in the soil and store it in their tissues.

With two other students, we presented the results of our research before three professional juries at the national CGénial competition and won the first prize.

We also presented our project during the International Radioprotection Congress in Dijon in 2018, as well as in Cambridge, UK, in 2019, during a scientific trip offered by SLB for our first prize.
